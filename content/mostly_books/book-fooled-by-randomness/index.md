My expectations were high and I ended up disappointed. In highlight it was obvious.

Praised by many authors and online personalities I respect and admire, I decided to read the first of the Incerto books. 

For context, I share many of Taleb's views before I read this book. From lack of probability understanding among supposed experts, to probability as a way of thinking beyond math, to understanding life outcomes better using probability. Still, so much noise in the book. 

The good: 

- Nero's story and the monkey type story at te beginning of the book is the most interesting part.  They were well narrated and got enough length to convey both the parable and the learnings. That could have been 2 long articles that I would have praised. 

- Conditional expectations applied to life scenarios (e.g. dentist are richer than NFL quarterbacks on expectation). 

- Compare yourself with your correct population distribution to be happy. 

- Karl Popper philosophy.


The bad: 

- The longer the less interesting it gets. It seems that he writes for the amusement of himself rather than for the reader. He is as egocentric as a person as he is as a writer. This has nothing to do with the tone, it's simply that contentwise it has a lot of noise that can be trimmed with no loss. The *quality* of the signal is great but awful *quantity* signal to noise ratio. 

- Most of his ideas seems that doesn't have the time to be structured and jumped from the authors head to the page without filter. There are chapters (I guess in order to this be called a book?) but the content is a mess - he is his own editor and it shows. 

- He rants way too much about journalist, economist and MBAs for not understanding probability and  having profesional success based on luck. After the fifth mention...it comes as jealousy as he doesn't receive as much attention himself. In any case, itâ€™s just childish to have a personal vendetta againts a profesion and taking any opportunity to let the reader know.

- Part II dedicated to psychology and behavioural economics. It's not clear to me that he seems to be the wisest about probability but the concept of sample size evades him. My guess is that since he doesn't like to write papers, he doesn't like to read them either. The behavioural and evolutionary concepts mentioned aligns with what he thinks so it fits his book narrative (confirmation bias).  At least he admits openly that can be fooled by randomness and biases as anyone else.
