## About what to do

- If you’re not feeling “Hell yeah, that would be awesome!” about something, say no. It’s an easier decision. **Say no to almost everything**.

- _“Hell yeah or no”_ is a filter you can use to decide what’s worth doing. But this is simpler and more serious. This is a decision to stop deciding. It’s one decision, in advance, that the answer to all future distractions is “no” until you finish what you started. It’s **saying yes to one thing, and no to absolutely everything else**.

- Like everyone, I have a list of boring chores that need to be done but that I’ve been putting off for years. I never do them because I’m always more excited about something else. During my last unmotivated funk, I realized that because nothing is exciting me, that means nothing is exciting me more than this boring necessary stuff. It is the perfect time to do those dull tasks. The **next time you’re feeling extremely unmotivated**, do those things you never want to do anyway.

- **What do you hate not doing?** What makes you feel depressed, annoyed, or like your life has gone astray if you don’t do it enough?

- No matter what you tell the world or tell yourself, **your actions reveal your real values**. Your actions show you what you actually want.

- Stop lying to yourself, and **admit your real priorities**. Start doing what you say you want to do, and see if it’s really true.

- Before you start something, think of the ways it could end. Sometimes the smart choice is to say no to the whole game.

## About mindset

- If we hate doing something, we think of it as hard. We picture it having many annoying steps. If we love doing something it seems simple. We think of it as one fun step. Even **if you say you want to do something, if you catch yourself thinking of it in many tedious steps, maybe you don’t really want to do it**.

- Most people overestimate what they can do in one year, and underestimate what they can do in ten years.

- Getting out of a bad state of mind:

  1. Ask myself what’s wrong in this very second.
  2. Observe now. Act later.
  3. Raise standards. Say no to anything less than great. When I’m down, I avoid anyone who doesn’t rejuvenate me.
  4. Focus on my goal.
  5. Do all the necessary stuff. These tasks are so mundane, but they help me to feel on top of things. When everyday responsibilities are done, my mind is less distracted.

- When I notice that I’m all stressed out about something or driving myself to exhaustion, I remember that bike ride and **try dialing back my effort by 50 percent. It’s been amazing how often everything gets done just as well** and just as fast, with what feels like half the effort.

- **All the best, happiest, and most creatively productive times in my life have something in common: being disconnected**. No internet. No TV. No phone. No people. Long uninterrupted solitude.

- **Constantly seeking inspiration is anti-inspiring**. You have to pause the input and focus on your output. For every bit of inspiration you take in, use it and amplify it by applying it to your work. Then you’ll finally feel the inspiration you’ve been looking for. Breathe in. Breathe out. Breathe in. Breathe out.

- **Whatever scares you, go do it**. Fear is just a form of excitement, and you know you should do what excites you.

## About business

- You know that existing business that you wish you had thought of? Copy it. Why? Because **we’re imperfect mirrors**. Like a funhouse mirror that distorts what it reflects, your imitation will turn out much different from the original. Maybe even better.

- Which then makes me realize that half of my effort wasn’t effort at all, but just unnecessary stress that made me feel like I was doing my best
